## SXMO Bitwarden
Userscript to enable browsing entries in bitwarden using dmenu

Note: It is little slow due to `bitwarden-cli`, I will try to optimize
but there is not much to do

Features missing:
- [ ] Disable notifications
- [ ] Logging in with something else then email and password
- [ ] TOTP
- [ ] Better searching (little slow now)

## Installing:
- install `bitwarden-cli`
- - Archlinux `sudo pacman -S bitwarden-cli`
- copy userscript to `~/.config/sxmo/userscripts/sxmo_bitwarden.sh`
